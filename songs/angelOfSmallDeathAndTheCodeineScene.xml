    <lyrics>
        <verse1>
            <stanza>
                <line>I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful</line>
                <line>Toying somewhere between love and abuse</line>
                <line>Calling to join them the wretched and joyful</line>
                <line>Shaking the wings of their terrible youths</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion</line>
                <line>No more alone or myself could I be</line>
                <line> Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open</line>
                <line> No shortage of sordid, no protest from me</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse1>
        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean</line>
                <line>She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</line>
                <line>With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean</line>
                <line>She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</line>
            </stanza>
        </chorus>
        <verse2>
            <stanza>
                <line>Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I</line>
                <line>Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet</line>
                <line>Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile</line>
                <line>It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse2>
        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean</line>
                <line>She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</line>
                <line>With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean</line>
                <line>She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</line>
            </stanza>

            <stanza>
                <line>Oh, oh, oh, oh</line>
                <line>Oh, oh, oh-oh</line>
                <line>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh</line>
