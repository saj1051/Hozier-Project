        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>Rare is this love</line>
                <line>Keep it covered</line>
                <line>I need you to run to me, run to me, lover</line>
                <line>Run until you feel your lungs bleeding</line>
            </stanza>
        </chorus>
        <verse_1>
            <stanza>
                <line>Oh but the farrow know</line>
                <line>Her hungry eyes, her ancient soul</line>
                <line>It's carried by the sneering menagerie</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Know what it is to grow</line>
                <line>Beneath her sky, her punishing cold</line>
                <line>To slowly learn of her ancient misery</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>To be twisted by something</line>
                <line>A shame without a sin</line>
                <line>Like how she twisted the bog man</line>
                <line>After she married him</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_1>

        <verse_2>
            <stanza>
                <line>But in all the world</line>
                <line>There is one lover worthy of her</line>
                <line>With as many souls claimed as she</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>But for all he's worth</line>
                <line>He still shatters always on her earth</line>
                <line>The cause of every tear she'd ever weep</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Rushing to shore to meet her</line>
                <line>Foaming with loneliness</line>
                <line>White hands to fondle and beat her</line>
                <line>Give her his onliness</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_2>
