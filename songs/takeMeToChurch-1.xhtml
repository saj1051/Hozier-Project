      <h2>Take Me To Church</h2>
      <article>
         <p>My lover's got humor<br/>
            She's the giggle at a funeral<br/>
            Knows everybody's disapproval<br/>
            I should've worshipped her
            sooner<br/>
            If the heavensever did
            speak<br/>
            She's the last true mouthpiece<br/>
            Every Sunday's getting more
            bleak<br/>
            A fresh poison each week<br/>
            "We were born sick"<br/>
            You heard them say it<br/>
            My church offers no
            absolutes<br/>
            She tells me "worship in
            the bedroom"<br/>
            The only Heaven I'll be sent
            to<br/>
            Is when I'm alone with you<br/>
            I was born sick, but I love
            it<br/>
            Command me to be well</p>
         <p>Aaa, Amen,
            Amen, Amen</p>
         <p>Take me to church<br/>
            I'll worship like a dog at
            the shrine of your lies<br/>
            I'll tell you my sins and you can
            sharpen your knife<br/>
            Offer me that deathless death<br/>
            Good God, let me give you my life<br/>
            Take me to church<br/>
            I'll worship like a dog at
            the shrine of your lies<br/>
            I'll tell you my sins and you can
            sharpen your knife<br/>
            Offer me that deathless death<br/>
            Good God, let me give you my life</p>
         <p>I'f I'm a pagan of the good
            times<br/>
            My lover's the sunlight<br/>
            To keep the goddess on my side<br/>
            She demands a sacrifice<br/>
            Drain the whole sea<br/>
            Get something shiny<br/>
            Something meaty for the main course<br/>
            That's a fine looking high horse<br/>
            What you got in the stable?<br/>
            We've a lot of starving faithful<br/>
            That looks tasty<br/>
            That looks plenty<br/>
            This is hungry work</p>
         <p>Aaa, Amen,
            Amen, Amen</p>
         <p>Take me to church<br/>
            I'll worship like a dog at
            the shrine of your lies<br/>
            I'll tell you my sins and you can
            sharpen your knife<br/>
            Offer me that deathless death<br/>
            Good God, let me give you my life<br/>
            Take me to church<br/>
            I'll worship like a dog at
            the shrine of your lies<br/>
            I'll tell you my sins and you can
            sharpen your knife<br/>
            Offer me that deathless death<br/>
            Good God, let me give you my life</p>
         <p>No masters of kings when the ritual begins<br/>
            There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle
            sin<br/>
            In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene<br/>
            Only then I am human<br/>
            Only then I am clean</p>
         <p>Take me to <br/>
            I'll worship like a dog at
            the shrine of your lies<br/>
            I'll tell you my sins and you can
            sharpen your knife<br/>
            Offer me that deathless death<br/>
            Good God, let me give you my life<br/>
            Take me to church<br/>
            I'll worship like a dog at
            the shrine of your lies<br/>
            I'll tell you my sins and you can
            sharpen your knife<br/>
            Offer me that deathless death<br/>
            Good God, let me give you my life</p>
