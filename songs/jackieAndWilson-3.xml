                <line>So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes</line>
                <line>No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight</line>
                <line>Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine</line>
                <line>For reasons wretched and divine</line>

                        the wild</religiousReference></line>
                <line>Laughing her way through my feeble disguise</line>
                <line>No other version of me I would rather be tonight</line>
                <line>And <religiousFigure figure="Lord">Lord</religiousFigure>, she found me just
                    in time</line>

        <preChorus>

                <line>'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done</line>
                <line>I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, <religiousFigure figure="God"

                <line>She's gonna save me, call me baby</line>
                <line>Run her hands through my hair</line>
                <line>She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily</line>

                <line>Me and my <religiousReference reference="Egytpian">Isis</religiousReference> growing
                    black irises in the sunshine</line>
                <line>Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside</line>

                <line>Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left</line>
                <line>I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little
