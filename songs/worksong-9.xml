        <verse_1>
            <stanza>
                <line>Boys, workin' on that empty</line>
                <line>Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?</line>
                <line>I just think about my baby</line>
                <line>I'm just so full of love I could barely eat</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>There's nothing sweeter than my baby</line>
                <line>I'd never want once from the cherry tree</line>
                <line>'Cause my baby's as sweet as can be</line>
                <line>She gives me toothaches just from kissin' me</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_1>
        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>When, my, time comes around</line>
                <line>Lay me gently in the cold dark earth</line>
                <line>No grave can hold my body down</line>
                <line>I'll crawl home to her</line>
            </stanza>
        </chorus>
        <verse_2>
            <stanza>
                <line>Boys, when my baby found me</line>
                <line>I was three days on a drunken sin</line>
                <line>I woke with her walls around me</line>
                <line>Nothin' in her room but an empty crib</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>And I was burning up a fever</line>
                <line>I didn't care much how long I loved</line>
                <line>But I swear, I thought I dreamed her</line>
                <line>She never asked me once about the wrong I did</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_2>
        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>When, my, time comes around</line>
                <line>Lay me gently in the cold dark earth</line>
                <line>No grave can hold my body down</line>
                <line>I'll crawl home to her</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>My babe would never fret none</line>
                <line>About what my hands and my body have done</line>
                <line>If the Lord don't forgive me</line>
                <line>I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>When I was kissin' on my baby</line>
                <line>And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet</line>
                <line>In the low lamp light, I was free</line>
                <line>Heaven and hell were words to me</line>
