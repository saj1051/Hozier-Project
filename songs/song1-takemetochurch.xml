<lyrics>
    <verse_1>
        <stanza>
            <line>My lover's got humor</line>
            <line>She's the giggle at a funeral</line>
            <line>Knows everybody's disapproval</line>
            <line>I should've worshipped her sooner</line>
            <line>If the heavens ever did speak</line>
            <line>She's the last true mouthpiece</line>
            <line>Every Sunday's getting more bleak</line>
            <line>A fresh poison each week</line>
            <line>"We were born sick"</line>
            <line>You heard them say it</line>
            <line>My church offers no absolutes</line>
            <line>She tells me "Worship in the bedroom"</line>
            <line>The only Heaven I'll be sent to</line>
            <line>Is when I'm alone with you</line>
            <line>I was born sick, but I love it</line>
            <line>Command me to be well</line>
        </stanza>
    </verse_1>
    <chorus>
        <stanza>
            <prechorus>Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen</prechorus>
            <line>Take me to church</line>
            <line>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies</line>
            <line>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife</line>
            <line>Offer me that deathless death</line>
            <line>Good God, let me give you my life</line>
            <line>Take me to church</line>
            <line>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies</line>
            <line>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife</line>
            <line>Offer me that deathless death</line>
            <line>Good God, let me give you my life</line>
        </stanza>

    <verse_2>
        <stanza>
            <line>I'f I'm a pagan of the good times</line>
            <line>My lover's the sunlight</line>
            <line>To keep the goddess on my side</line>
            <line>She demands a sacrifice</line>
            <line>Drain the whole sea</line>
            <line>Get something shiny</line>
            <line>Something meaty for the main course</line>
            <line>That's a fine looking high horse</line>
            <line>What you got in the stable?</line>
            <line>We've a lot of starving faithful</line>
            <line>That looks tasty</line>
            <line>That looks plenty</line>
            <line>This is hungry work</line>

        </stanza>
    </chorus>
    <bridge>
        <stanza>
            <line>No masters of kings when the ritual begins</line>
            <line>There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin</line>
            <line>In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene</line>
            <line>Only then I am human</line>
            <line>Only then I am clean</line>
        </stanza>
