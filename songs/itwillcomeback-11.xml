        <stanza>
            <line>You know better, babe, you know better, babe</line>
            <line>Than to look at it, look at it like that</line>
            <line>You know better, babe, you know better, babe</line>
            <line>Than to talk to it, talk to it like that</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul</line>
            <line>Honey, make this easy</line>
            <line>Leave it to the land, this is what it knows</line>
            <line>Honey, that's how it sleeps</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Don't let it in with no intention to keep it</line>
            <line>Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it</line>
            <line>Honey, don't feed it, it will come back</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>You know better babe, you know better, babe</line>
            <line>Than to smile at me, smile at me like that</line>
            <line>You know better babe, you know better babe</line>
            <line>Than to hold me just, hold me just like that</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>I know who I am when I'm alone</line>
            <line>I'm something else when I see you</line>
            <line>You don't understand, you should never know</line>
            <line>How easy you are to need</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Don't let me in with no intention to keep me</line>
            <line>Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me</line>
            <line>Honey, don't feed me, I will come back</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>It can't be unlearned</line>
            <line>I've known the warmth of your doorways</line>
            <line>Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Oh, please, give me mercy no more</line>
            <line>That's a kindness you can't afford</line>
            <line>I warn you, baby, each night, as sure as you're born</line>
            <line>You'll hear me howling outside your door</line>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <line>Don't you hear me howling, babe?</line>
            <line>Don't you hear me howling, babe?</line>
            <line>Don't you hear me howling, babe?</line>
            <line>Don't you hear me howling?</line>
            <line>Don't you hear me howling?</line>
            <line>Don't you hear me howling, babe?</line>
