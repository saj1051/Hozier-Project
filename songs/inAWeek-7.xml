                <line>I have never known peace</line>
                <line><litDevice device="simile">Like the damp grass that yields to me</litDevice></line>
                <line>I have never known hunger</line>

                <line>A thousand teeth</line>
                <line>And yours among them, I know</line>
                <line>Our hungers appeased</line>
                <line>Our heartbeats becoming slow</line>

                <line>We'll lay here for years or for hours</line>
                <line>Thrown here of found, to freeze or to thaw</line>
                <line><litDevice device="metaphor">So long, we'd become the flowers</litDevice></line>
                <line><litDevice device="metaphor">Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw</litDevice></line>

        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>And they'd find us in a week</line>
                <line>When the weather gets hot</line>
                <line>After the insects have made their claim</line>
                <line>I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you</line>

                <line><litDevice device="simile">Like this slumber that creeps to me</litDevice></line>
                <line>I have never known colour</line>

                <line>And you haven't moved an inch</line>
                <line>Such that I would not know</line>
                <line>If you sleep alwyas like this</line>
                <line>The flesh calmly going cold</line>

                <line>Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet</line>
                <line><litDevice device="metaphor">So long, we'd become the flowers</litDevice></line>
