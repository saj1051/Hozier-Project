        <verse1>
            <stanza>
                <line>I had a thought, dear, however scary</line>
                <line>About that night, the bugs and the dirt</line>
                <line>Why were you digging? What did you bury</line>
                <line>Before those hands pulled me from the earth?</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>I will not ask you where you came from</line>
                <line>I will not ask and neither should you</line>
                <line>Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips</line>
                <line>We should just kiss like real people do</line>
            </stanza>

        <verse2>
            <stanza>
                <line>I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking</line>
                <line>Was there in someone that dug long ago</line>
                <line>So I will not ask you why you were creeping</line>
                <line>In some sad way, I already know</line>

        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>So I will not ask you where you came from</line>
                <line>I would not ask and neither would you</line>
                <line>Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips</line>
                <line>We should just kiss like real people do</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>I could not ask you where you came from</line>
                <line>I could not ask and neither could you</line>
                <line>Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips</line>
                <line>We could just kiss like real people do</line>
