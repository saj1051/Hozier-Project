        <verse_1>
            <stanza>
                <line>Her eyes and words are so icy</line>
                <line>Oh, but she burns</line>
                <line>Like rum on a fire</line>
                <line>Hot and fast and angry as she can be</line>
                <line>I walk my days on a wire</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_1>
        <chorus>
            <prechorus>
                <stanza>
                    <line>It looks ugly, but it's clean</line>
                    <line>Oh mama, don't fuss over me</line>
                </stanza>
            </prechorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine</line>
                <line>Open hand or closed fist would be fine</line>
                <line>The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine</line>
            </stanza>
        </chorus>
        <verse_2>
            <stanza>
                <line>Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she strains</line>
                <line>The sheets of some other</line>
                <line>Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws</line>
                <line>With the arm of her brother</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_2>
        <chorus>
            <prechorus>
                <stanza>
                    <line>But I want it, it's a crime</line>
                    <line>That she's not around most of the time</line>
                </stanza>
            </prechorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine</line>
                <line>Open hand or closed fist would be fine</line>
                <line>The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine</line>
            </stanza>
        </chorus>
        <verse_3>
            <stanza>
                <line>Her fight and fury's fiery</line>
                <line>Oh, but she looks</line>
                <line>Like sleep to the freezing</line>
                <line>Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed</line>
                <line>In the tide of her breathing</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse_3>
        <chorus>
            <prechorus>
                <stanza>
                    <line>And it's worth it, it's divine</line>
                    <line>I have this some of the time</line>
                </stanza>
            </prechorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine</line>
                <line>Open hand or closed fist would be fine</line>
                <line>The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine</line>
            </stanza>
