        <verse number="1">
            <stanza>
                <line>So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes</line>
                <line>No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight</line>
                <line>Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine</line>
                <line>For reasons wretched and divine</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse>
        <verse number="2">
            <stanza>
                <line>She blows out of nowhere, <myth reference="a roman candle of the wild"></myth></line>
                <line>Laughing her way through my feeble disguise</line>
                <line>No other version of me I would rather be tonight</line>
                <line>And <religious_figure christianity="Lord"></religious_figure>, <person>she</person> found me just in time</line>
            </stanza>
        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <prechorus>
                <line>'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done</line>
                <line>I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, <religious_figure christianity="God"></religious_figure>, I never felt young</line>
            </prechorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>She's gonna save me, call me baby</line>
                <line>Run her hands through my hair</line>
                <line>She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily</line>
                <line>Better yet, she wouldn't care</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives</line>
                <line>Ride 'round picking up clues</line>
                <line>We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson</line>
                <line>Raise 'em on rhythm and blues</line>

            <stanza>
                <line><religious_figure christianity="Lord"></religious_figure>, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime</line>
                <line>Me and my <myth reference="Isis"></myth> growing black irises in the sunshine</line>
                <line>Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside</line>
                <line>We'd sit back and watch the world go by</line>

            <prechorus>
                <line>Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust</line>
                <line>We tried the world; good <religious_figure christianity="God"></religious_figure> it wasn't for us</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset</line>
                <line>Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left</line>
                <line>I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little
