      <h2>From Eden</h2>
      <article>
         <p>Babe<br/>
            There's something tragic about you<br/>
            Something so magic about you<br/>
            Don't you agree?Babe<br/>
            There's something lonesome about you<br/>
            Something so wholesome about you<br/>
            Get closer to me</p>
         <p>No tired sigh, no rolling eyes<br/>
            No irony<br/>
            No "Who cares?", no vacant stare<br/>
            No time for me</p>
         <p>Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago<br/>
            Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword<br/>
            Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know<br/>
             I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door</p>
         <p>Babe<br/>
            There's something wretchedabout this<br/>
            Something so precious about this<br/>
            Where to begin?Babe<br/>
            There's something broken about this<br/>
            But I might be hoping about this<br/>
            Oh, what a sin</p>
         <p>To the strand, a picnic planned<br/>
            For you and me<br/>
            A rope in hand for your other man<br/>
            To hang from a tree</p>
         <p>Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago<br/>
            Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword<br/>
            Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know<br/>
             I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door</p>
         <p>Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago<br/>
            Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword<br/>
            Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know<br/>
             I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door</p>
