      <article>
         <p>So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes<br/>
            No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight<br/>
            Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine<br/>
            For reasons wretched and divine</p>
         <p>She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of
            the wild<br/>
            Laughing her way through my feeble disguise<br/>
            No other version of me I would rather be tonight<br/>
            And Lord, she found me just
            in time</p>
         <p>'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done<br/>
            I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young</p>
         <p>She's gonna save me, call me baby<br/>
            Run her hands through my hair<br/>
            She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily<br/>
            Better yet, she wouldn't careWe'll steal a Lexus, be detectives<br/>
            Ride 'round picking up clues<br/>
            We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson<br/>
            Raise 'em on rhythm and blues</p>
         <p>Lord, it'd be great to find a
            place we could escape sometime<br/>
            Me and my Isis growing
            black irises in the sunshine<br/>
            Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside<br/>
            We'd sit back and watch the world go by</p>
         <p>Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust<br/>
            We tried the world; good God
            it wasn't for us</p>
         <p>She's gonna save me, call me baby<br/>
            Run her hands through my hair<br/>
            She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily<br/>
            Better yet, she wouldn't careWe'll steal a Lexus, be detectives<br/>
            Ride 'round picking up clues<br/>
            We'll name our children Jackie and
            Wilson<br/>
            Raise 'em on rhythm and blues</p>
         <p>Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset<br/>
            Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left<br/>
            I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little
            vignette<br/>
            For whatever poor soul is coming next</p>
         <p>She's gonna save me, call me baby<br/>
            Run her hands through my hair<br/>
            She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily<br/>
            Better yet, she wouldn't careWe'll steal a Lexus, be detectives<br/>
            Ride 'round picking up clues<br/>
            We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson<br/>
            Raise 'em on rhythm and blues</p>
