            <stanza>
                <line>When I was a child, I heard voices</line>
                <line>Some would sing and some would scream</line>
                <line>You soon find you have few choices</line>
                <line>I learned the voices died with me</line>
                <line>When I was a child, I'd sit for hours</line>
                <line>Staring into open flame</line>
                <line>Something in it had a power</line>
                <line>Could barely tear my eyes away</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>All you have is your fire</line>
                <line>And the place you need to reach</line>
                <line>Don't you ever tame your demons</line>
                <line>But always keep them on a leash</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me</line>
                <line>Thought gasoline was on my clothes</line>
                <line>I knew that something would always rule me</line>
                <line> I knew this scent was mine alone </line>

                <line>When I knew love's perfect ache</line>
                <line>But my peace has always depended</line>
                <line>On all the ashes in my wake</line>
