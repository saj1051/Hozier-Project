        <verse>
            <stanza>
                <line>I watch the work of my kin, <litDevice device = "alliteration">bold and boyful</litDevice></line>
                <line>Toying somewhere between love and abuse</line>
                <line>Calling to join them the wretched and joyful</line>
                <line><litDevice device = "metaphor">Shaking the wings of their terrible youths</litDevice></line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion</line>
                <line>No more alone or myself could I be</line>
                <line>Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open</line>
                <line>No shortage of sordid, no protest from me</line>

        </verse>
        <chorus>
            <stanza>
                <line>With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean</line>
                <line>She's the <religiousFigure religion = "christianity">angel</religiousFigure> of small death and the codeine scene</line>
                <line>With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean</line>
                <line>She's the <religiousFigure religion = "christianity">angel</religiousFigure> of small death and the codeine scene</line>

        <verse>
            <stanza>
                <line>Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I</line>
                <line><litDevice device = "metaphor">Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet</litDevice></line>
                <line>Fresh from the fields, all <litDevice device = "alliteration">fetor and fertile</litDevice></line>
                <line>It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet</line>
