        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <h3>Research Topic</h3>
        <p>Through Hozier’s lyrics on his self-titled album “Hozier”, we will look at the way he
            uses religious analogies and literary devices in his lyrics to talk about his
            relationships with women, himself, and religion.</p>
        <!--our methods for the project-->
        <h2>Methods and Analyzation</h2>
        <p>We started this project by converting each lyric into an XML file; in each file, we broke
            the song down into elements beginning at song, and then descending to lyrics, verse,
            stanza, chorus, line, etc.</p>
        <p>After we had the XML files properly structured, we began the markup process of the
            lyrics. Our markup includes the elements “religiousAction”, “religiousPlace”,
            “religiousConcept”, “religiousReference”, “religiousFigure”, and “litDevice”. We chose
            these elements because we decided they would best be able to help us analyze how
            Hozier’s view of religion impacts his personal relationships and how he views the world.
            By tagging literary devices, we also were able to analyze his relationships, especially
            with women.</p>
        <p>Hozier's debut album was chosen for this project because it featured his more prominent
            hit "Take Me to Church", which deals directly with his relationship with religion. The
            reason religion is the focus of this project is because the topic is incredibly
            complicated for so many people, and Hozier explores this at length in his album in a way
            that is unique and poetic. Hozier's indepth look at religion, particularly Catholicism,
            in his album allows for listeners to get a feel for the impact that it's had on nearly
            every aspect of his life. The hope of the project was to analyze Hozier's relationship
            with religion and not only gain a better understanding of religion in society as a
            whole.</p>
        <p>It was also important for us that we have a decent knowledge of Hozier, his background as
            a musician, and his background with religion - especially Christianity. See below for
            some of our most important research.</p>

        <p>Andrew Hozier-Byrne, known professionally as Hozier, is a 31-year-old Irish musician
            known for his unique music style. Hozier’s songs consist of a mix of blues, gospel, and
            soul music that has led him to international fame. He is most well-known for his song
            “Take Me to Church”, which peaked at 100 on the U.S. Billboard charts. To date, he has
            released two full-length albums: “Hozier” and “Wasteland, Baby!”. Prior to his solo
            success, he toured with an Irish choral group known as Anuna.</p>

        <p>Hozier is a self-taught guitar player and songwriter. In an interview, he said that he
            tries to record more from his home to create a sound that he feels closer to. He says he
            likes to start with some sort of core feeling or a few lines that convey a message; from
            there, he loosely plays with ideas and melodies until he finds what he likes. He
            describes his writing style as simple and straightforward; “I try not to lean too much
            on verbose phrases, attempting to cut right to the heart of the sentiment.”</p>
        <!--Hozier's views on religion-->
        <h3>Hozier and Religion</h3>
        <p>Religion has been a source of frustration for Hozier. He grew up Catholic, but found the
            church very hypocritical. He channeled this anger into his breakout hit “Take Me to
            Church’. Despite his frustrations, he says that he wouldn’t label himself as an atheist,
            and is comfortable not knowing much about higher powers. In an interview with Ireland’s
            National Public Service Radio, Hozier says that he has strong opinions regarding the
            Catholic church and says that the effects of religion are certainly generational. He
            goes on to say that the damage the church has done to Ireland is “irreparable”, and he
            believes faith as a whole is an absurd concept.</p>
