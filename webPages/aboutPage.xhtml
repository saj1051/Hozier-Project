        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>Through Hozier’s lyrics on his self-titled album “Hozier”, we will analyze the way in
            which religion is expressed through song and how that relates to his view of religion
            and it’s impact on society. </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Hozier's debut album was chosen for this project because it featured his more prominent
            hit "Take Me to Church", which deals directly with his relationship with religion. The
            reason religion is the focus of this project is because the topic is incredibly
            complicated for so many people, and Hozier explores this at length in his album in a way
            that is unique and poetic. Hozier's indepth look at religion, particularly Catholicism,
            in his album allows for listeners to get a feel for the impact that it's had on nearly
            every aspect of his life. The hope of the project was to analyze Hozier's relationship
            with religion and not only gain a better understanding of religion in society as a
            whole.</p>
        <h2>Who is Hozier?</h2>
        <p>Andrew Hozier-Byrne, known professionally as Hozier, is a 31-year-old Irish musician
            known for his unique music style. Hozier’s songs consist of a mix of blues, gospel, and
            soul music that has led him to international fame. He is most well-known for his song
            “Take Me to Church”, which peaked at 100 on the U.S. Billboard charts. To date, he has
            released two full-length albums: “Hozier” and “Wasteland, Baby!”. Prior to his solo
            success, he toured with an Irish choral group known as Anuna.</p>
        <p>Hozier is a self-taught guitar player and songwriter. In an interview, he said that he
            tries to record more from his home to create a sound that he feels closer to. He says he
            likes to start with some sort of core feeling or a few lines that convey a message. From
            there, he loosely plays with ideas and melodies until he finds what he likes. He
            describes his writing style as simple and straightforward; “I try not to lean too much
            on verbose phrases, attempting to cut right to the heart of the sentiment.”</p>
        <h3>Hozier and Religion</h3>
        <p>Religion has been a source of frustration for Hozier. He grew up Catholic, but found the
            church very hypocritical. He channeled this anger into his breakout hit “Take Me to
            Church’. Despite his frustrations, he says that he wouldn’t label himself as an atheist,
            and is comfortable not knowing much about higher powers. In an interview with Ireland’s
            National Public Service Radio, Hozier says that he has strong opinions regarding the
            Catholic church and says that the effects of religion are certainly generational. He
            goes on to say that the damage the church has done to Ireland is “irreparable”, and he
            believes faith as a whole is an absurd concept.</p>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>The first step in this project was gathering all of the texts and marking them up. Each
            song's lyrics were put into an individual xml document and then tagged. The tags we used
            pertained to specific religious content, such as religious places or figures, as well as
            literary devices. After this was done, we were left with markup that with which we
            coulud analyze religion and how it's used as a literary device within his lyrics.</p>
        <h3>Literary Devices</h3>
        <p>The lyrics of Hozier are ripe with literary devices, particularly metaphors and
            allegories. We chose to look at the way in which Hozier turns religion into a literary
            device, and uses it to describe the effect it's had on his life. This was vital to
            unpacking our research question.</p>
