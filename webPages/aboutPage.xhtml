        <h1>Who is Hozier?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>General overview of the musician</li>
            <li><p>Andrew Hozier-Byrne, known professionally as Hozier, is a 31-year-old Irish
                    musician known for his unique music style. Hozier’s songs consist of a mix of
                    blues, gospel, and soul music that has led him to international fame. He is most
                    well-known for his song “Take Me to Church”, which peaked at 100 on the U.S.
                    Billboard charts. To date, he has released two full-length albums: “Hozier” and
                    “Wasteland, Baby!”. Prior to his solo success, he toured with an Irish choral
                    group known as Anuna.</p></li>
            <li>His writing style</li>
            <li><p>Hozier is a self-taught guitar player and songwriter.</p></li>
            <li>The use of literary devices and its significance</li>
            <li><p>Use of religion as a literary device and analyze how he critiques it.</p></li>
            <li>Look into his background with religion and if he has any critiques towards organized
                religion, specifically Christianity.</li>
            <li><p>Religion has been a source of frustration for Hozier. He grew up Catholic, but
                    found the church very hypocritical. He channeled this anger into his breakout
                    hit “Take Me to Church’. Despite his frustrations, he says that he wouldn’t
                    label himself as an atheist, and is comfortable not knowing much about higher
                    powers. In an interview with Ireland’s National Public Service Radio, Hozier
                    says that he has strong opinions regarding the Catholic church and says that the
                    effects of religion are certainly generational. He goes on to say that the
                    damage the church has done to Ireland is “irreparable”, and he believes faith as
                    a whole is an absurd concept.</p></li>
