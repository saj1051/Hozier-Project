        <p>This site will guide you through our project as we seek to analysize religion through
            contextual literary devices in the lyrics of Hozier's debut album, "Hozier". Our goal is
            to gain a better understanding of Hozier and and how his work reflects his relationship
            with religion.</p>
        <p>This project was completed as part of the Computational Methods and the Humanities course
            offered at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
