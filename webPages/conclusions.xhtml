        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>This is going to be where we answer our research question and go more in depth on our
            analysis with graphs and such.</p>
        <p>Religion has had on obvious impact on how Hozier views the world. There a lot of literary
            devices in each of the songs, so we'd like to go in depth and see how he uses them to critique religion 
            and talk about his relationships.</p>
        <p>SVG will definitely come into play here.</p>
