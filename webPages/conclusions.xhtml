            <h2>Analysis</h2>
             <h3>Prevelence of Religion</h3>
            <p>In nearly all of the songs on Hozier's debut album, religious references are
               made. As our above graph indicates, religious references were the most common form
               of religious mention in Hozier's lyrics. Religous references included mentions of specific
               religions, such as paganism, or concepts, such as sin. The next most common form of religious
               mention was religious figures, such as God or angels. Following this was religious actions, which
               primarily included praying and worship. Next was religious places, like a church. Finally, religious
               concepts were the least prevelent form of religious mention in Hozier's lyrics, such as demons.</p>
            <h3>Ireland and Religion</h3>
            <p>Hozier makes a few references to Catholicism and his home conutry of Ireland,
               most notably in "Foreigner's God". Paganism was mentioned frequently in this song as he describes
               the way in which Ireland's pagan roots were wiped out by Christianity. It is clear from the literary
               devices that Hozier feels very negatively about this. The lines "But still my heart is heavy/with the
               hate of some other man's beliefs" he uses symbolism to show his distaste for what Christianity, and more
               specifically Catholicism, has done to his home country.</p>
            <h3>Religion and Hozier's Relationships</h3>
            <p>Religion has an obvious impact on Hozier's relationships, as he relays through
               his lyrics. "Take Me to Church", his most popular song, clearly shows this. To him, being in a 
               many religions make people feel as if the perfectly natural feelings of attraction that people have
               are wrong and contridictory to religious teachings. The line "I was born sick, but I love it/command 
               me to be well" references sin as sickness, and can be considered a reference to sexuality. Religion 
               is percieved by Hozier as a negative influence on people's abilities to form romantic and/or sexual
               relationships. In "From Eden" Hozier relates his relationship with a women to sin throughout the song,
               again making the association between sin, a negative religious concept, and relationships. For Hozier
               personally, relationships are a religious experience in and of themselves. In "Cherry Wine (Live)",
               he writes "And it's worth it, it's divine/I have this some of the time". The song is referencing an 
               abusive relationship that he has with a woman who treats him terribly, but at the same time the experience
               is similar to how he's experienced religion; not good, but at times, not bad.</p>
            <h3>Religion and Society at Large</h3>
            <p>The way that Hozier views society is impact by religion and his afore mentioned
               views on it. In terms of relationships, Hozier believes that religion has had a large negative impact
               both on his own relationships and the relationships of others. Religion is this all consuming entity that
               controls his country and the people he interacts with. Sin is brought up many times in his lyrics, and this
               concept is something that he seems to struggle with the most. Reconciling good and evil is difficult at best
               Hozier, and it changes how he partipates in society. While he offers no solutions for how to change this 
               negative relationship with religion, he does at times positively describe religion broadly, such as when he
               equates loving a women with a divine experience.</p>
