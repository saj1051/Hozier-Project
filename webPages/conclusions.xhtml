        <ul>
            <li><h2>Analysis</h2></li>
            <li><h3>Prevelence of Religion</h3></li>
            <li><p>In nearly all of the songs on Hozier's debut album, religious references are made.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Ireland and Religion</h3></li>
            <li><p>Hozier makes a few references to Catholicism and his home conutry of Ireland, most notably in "Foreigner's God".</p></li>
            <li><h3>Religion and Hozier's Relationships</h3></li>
            <li><p>Religion has an obvious impact on Hozier's relationships, as he relays thourgh his lyrics.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Religion and Society at Large</h3></li>
            <li><p>The way that Hozier views society is impact by religion and his afore mentioned views on it.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is going to be where we answer our research question and go more in depth on our
            analysis with graphs and such.</p>
        <p>Religion has had on obvious impact on how Hozier views the world. There a lot of literary
            devices in each of the songs, so we'd like to go in depth and see how he uses them to critique religion 
            and talk about his relationships.</p>
        <p>SVG will definitely come into play here.</p>
