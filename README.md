# Hozier-Project
For this project, we will explore songs on the album “Hozier” by Irish singer-songwriter Hozier. The main focus would be religious imagery, particularly from ancient religions as well as Christianity. In total, there are 17 songs on the album, and for this project we will look at them all in their entirety. The main research question about be analyzing the way in which religion is expressed within his lyrics and how that relates to the modern-day world view and culture. In order to do this, we will need to do a deep textual analysis of the songs, marking any potential religious references. After we have those references, some background research will need to be done to fully explore the context. This might include supplemental materials like the Bible or other religious texts or materials (he also references Greek mythology quite a bit). The ultimate goal is to understand religion and how it can influence individual world views. Hozier’s doesn’t always portray religion in a positive light, and can be critical of Christianity at times, but nonetheless it impacts how he sees the world, which I think can apply to many other people as well. There is a possibility of doing this same analysis to his second album and comparing the two, depending on the projected project timeline.
