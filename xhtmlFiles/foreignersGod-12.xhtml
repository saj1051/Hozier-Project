      <h2>Foreigner's God</h2>
      <article>
         <p>She moved with shameless wonder<br/>
            The perfect creature rarely seen<br/>
            Since some liar brought the thunder<br/>
            When the land was godless and free<br/>
            The perfect creature rarely seen<br/>
            Since some liar brought the thunder<br/>
            When the land was godless and freeHer eyes look sharp and steady<br/>
            Into the empty parts of me<br/>
            But still my heart is heavy<br/>
            With the hate of some other man's beliefs</p>
         <p>Always a well dressed fraud<br/>
            Who wouldn't spare the rod<br/>
            Never for me</p>
         <p>Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            The purest expression of grief<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            The purest expression of grief</p>
         <p>Wondering who I copy<br/>
            Mustering some tender charm<br/>
            She feels no control of her body<br/>
            She feels no safety in my armsI've no language left to say it<br/>
            But all I do is quake to her<br/>
            Breaking if I try convey it<br/>
            The broken love I make to her</p>
         <p>All that I've been taught<br/>
            And every word I've got<br/>
            Is foreign to me</p>
         <p>Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
            Screaming the name<br/>
            Of a foreigner's God<br/>
