         <p>Boys, workin' on that empty<br/>
            Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?<br/>
            I just think about my baby<br/>
            I'm just so full of love I could barely eatThere's nothing sweeter than my baby<br/>
            I'd never want once from the cherry tree<br/>
            'Cause my baby's as sweet as can be<br/>
            She gives me toothaches just from kissin' me</p>
         <p>When, my, time comes around<br/>
            Lay me gently in the cold dark earth<br/>
            No grave can hold my body down<br/>
            I'll crawl home to her</p>
         <p>Boys, when my baby found me<br/>
            I was three days on a drunken sin<br/>
            I woke with her walls around me<br/>
            Nothin' in her room but an empty cribAnd I was burning up a fever<br/>
            I didn't care much how long I lived<br/>
            But I swear, I thought I dreamed her<br/>
            She never asked me once about the wrong I did</p>
         <p>When, my, time comes around<br/>
            Lay me gently in the cold dark earth<br/>
            No grave can hold my body down<br/>
            I'll crawl home to her</p>
         <p>When, my, time comes around<br/>
            Lay me gently in the cold dark earth<br/>
            No grave can hold my body down<br/>
            I'll crawl home to her</p>
         <p>My babe would never fret none<br/>
            About what my hands and my body have done<br/>
            If the Lord don't forgive me<br/>
            I'd still have my baby and my babe would have meWhen I was kissin' on my baby<br/>
            And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet<br/>
            In the low lamp light, I was free<br/>
            Heaven and hell were words to me</p>
         <p>When, my, time comes around<br/>
            Lay me gently in the cold dark earth<br/>
            No grave can hold my body down<br/>
            I'll crawl home to her</p>
         <p>When, my, time comes around<br/>
            Lay me gently in the cold dark earth<br/>
            No grave can hold my body down<br/>
            I'll crawl home to her</p>
