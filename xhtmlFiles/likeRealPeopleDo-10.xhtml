      <article>
         <p>I had a thought, dear, however scary<br/>
            About that night, the bugs and the dirt<br/>
            Why were you digging? What did you bury<br/>
            Before those hands pulled me from the earth?</p>
         <p>I will not ask you where you came from<br/>
            I will not ask and neither should you<br/>
            Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips<br/>
            We should just kiss like real people do</p>
         <p>I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking<br/>
            Was there in someone that dug long ago<br/>
            So I will not ask you why you were creeping<br/>
            In some sad way, I already know</p>
         <p>So I will not ask you where you came from<br/>
            I would not ask and neither would you<br/>
            Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips<br/>
            We should just kiss like real people do</p>
         <p>I could not ask you where you came from<br/>
            I could not ask and neither could you<br/>
            Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips<br/>
            We could just kiss like real people do</p>
