      <h2>Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene</h2>
      <article>
         <p>I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful<br/>
            Toying somewhere between love and abuse<br/>
            Calling to join them the wretched and joyful<br/>
            Shaking the wings of their terrible youthsFreshly disowned in some frozen devotion<br/>
            No more alone or myself could I be<br/>
            Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open<br/>
            No shortage of sordid, no protest from me</p>
         <p>With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene<br/>
            With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</p>
         <p>Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I<br/>
            Lay my heart down with the rest at herfeet<br/>
            Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile<br/>
            It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet</p>
         <p>With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene<br/>
            With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</p>
         <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
            Oh, oh, oh-oh<br/>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh<br/>
            Oh, oh, oh</p>
         <p>In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete<br/>
            Wonder if better now having survived<br/>
            The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet<br/>
            Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive</p>
         <p>With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene<br/>
            With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine sceneWith her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene<br/>
            With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean<br/>
            She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene</p>
