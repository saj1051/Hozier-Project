      <h2>Sedated</h2>
      <article>
         <p>Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzy<br/>
            To derail the mind of me<br/>
            Just a little hush, babe; my veins are busy<br/>
            But my heart's in atrophy</p>
         <p>Any way<br/>
            To distract and sedate<br/>
            Adding shadows<br/>
            To the walls of the cave</p>
         <p>You and I, nursing on a<br/>
            Poison that never stung<br/>
            Our teeth and lungs are lined<br/>
            With the scum of itSomewhere for this, death and guns<br/>
            We are deaf, we are numb<br/>
            Free and young and we<br/>
            Can feel none of it</p>
         <p>Something isn't right, babe; I keep catching<br/>
            Little words, but the meaning's thin<br/>
            I'm somewhere outside my life, babe; I keep scratching<br/>
            But somehow I can't get in</p>
         <p>So we're slaves<br/>
            To any semblance of touch<br/>
            Lord, we should quit<br/>
            But we love it too much</p>
         <p>Sedated, we're nursing on a<br/>
            Poison that never stung<br/>
            Our teeth and lungs are lined<br/>
            With the scum of itSomewhere for this, death and guns<br/>
            We are deaf, we are numb<br/>
            Free and young and we<br/>
            Can feel none of it</p>
         <p>Darlin', don't you<br/>
            Stand there watching, won't you<br/>
            Come and save me from it?Darlin', don't you<br/>
            Join in, you're supposed to<br/>
            Drag me away from it...</p>
         <p>Any way<br/>
            To distract and sedate<br/>
            Adding shadows<br/>
            To the walls of the cave</p>
         <p>You and I, nursing on a<br/>
            Poison that never stung<br/>
            Our teeth and lungs are lined<br/>
            With the scum of itSomewhere for this, death and guns<br/>
            We are deaf, we are numb<br/>
            Free and young and we<br/>
            Can feel none of it</p>
         <p>Sedated, we're nursing on a<br/>
            Poison that never stung<br/>
            Our teeth and lungs are lined<br/>
