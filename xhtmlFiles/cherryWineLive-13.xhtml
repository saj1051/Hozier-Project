      <article>
         <p>Her eyes and words are so icy<br/>
            Oh, but she burns<br/>
            Like rum on a fire<br/>
            Hot and fast and angry as she can be<br/>
            I walk my days on a wire</p>
         <p>It looks ugly, but it's
            clean<br/>
            Oh mama, don't fuss over me</p>
         <p>The way she tells me I'm hers and she is
            mine<br/>
            Open hand or closed fist would be
            fine<br/>
            The blood is rare and sweet as cherry
            wine</p>
         <p>Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she
            strains<br/>
            The sheets of some other<br/>
            Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws<br/>
            With the arm of her brother</p>
         <p>But I want it, it's a crime<br/>
            That she's not around most of the time</p>
         <p>The way she tells me I'm hers and she is
            mine<br/>
            Open hand or closed fist would be
            fine<br/>
            The blood is rare and sweet as cherry
            wine</p>
         <p>Her fight and fury's fiery<br/>
            Oh, but she looks<br/>
            Like sleep to the freezing<br/>
            Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but
            washed<br/>
            In the tide of her breathing</p>
         <p>And it's worth it, it's divine<br/>
            I have this some of the time</p>
         <p>The way she tells me I'm hers and she is
            mine<br/>
            Open hand or closed fist would be
            fine<br/>
            The blood is rare and sweet as cherry
            wine</p>
