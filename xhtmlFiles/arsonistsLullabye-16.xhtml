      <article>
         <p>When I was a child, I heard voices<br/>
            Some would sing and some would scream<br/>
            Some would sing and some would scream<br/>
            You soon find you have few choices<br/>
            I learned the voices died with me<br/>
            When I was a child, I'd sit for hours<br/>
            Staring into open flame<br/>
            Something in it had a power<br/>
            Could barely tear my eyes away</p>
         <p>All you have is your fire<br/>
            And the place you need to reach<br/>
            Don't you ever tame your demons<br/>
            But always keep them on a leash<br/>
            Don't you ever tame your demons<br/>
            But always keep them on a leash</p>
         <p>When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me<br/>
            Thought gasoline was on my clothes<br/>
            I knew that something would always ruleme<br/>
            I knew this scent was mine alone </p>
         <p>All you have is your fire<br/>
            And the place you need to reach<br/>
            Don't you ever tame your demons<br/>
            Always keep them on a leash<br/>
            Don't you ever tame your demons<br/>
            Always keep them on a leash</p>
         <p>When I was a man, I thought it ended<br/>
            When I knew love's perfect ache<br/>
            But my peace has always depended<br/>
            On all the ashes in my wake</p>
         <p>All you have is your fire<br/>
            And the place you need to reach<br/>
            Don't you ever tame your demons<br/>
            But always keep them on a leash<br/>
            Don't you ever tame your demons<br/>
            But always keep them on a leash</p>
