      <h2>To Be Alone</h2>
      <article>
         <p>Never feel too good in crowds<br/>
            With folks around, when they're playing<br/>
            The anthems of rape culture loud<br/>
            Crude and proud, creatures bayingAll I've ever done is hide<br/>
            From our times, when you're near me<br/>
            Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes<br/>
            I feel like a person for a moment of my life</p>
         <p>But you don't know what hell you put me through<br/>
            To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you<br/>
            To feel your weight in arms I'd never use<br/>
            It's the God that heroin prays
            to</p>
         <p>It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            Oh, to be alone with you</p>
         <p>Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</p>
         <p>There are questions I can't ask<br/>
            Now at last, the worst is over<br/>
            See the way you hold yourself<br/>
            Reel against, your body's bordersI know that you hate this place<br/>
            Not a trace of me would argue<br/>
            Honey, we should run away, oh someday<br/>
            Our baby and her momma, and the damaged love she made</p>
         <p>But I don't know what else that I would do<br/>
            Than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you<br/>
            Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use<br/>
            It's the god that heroin praysto</p>
         <p>It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            Oh, to be alone with you</p>
         <p>Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br/>
            Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohWhoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br/>
            Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</p>
         <p>It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            It feels good, girl, it feels good<br/>
            Oh, to be alone with you</p>
