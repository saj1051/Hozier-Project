      <h2>In the Woods Somewhere</h2>
      <article>
         <p>My head was warm<br/>
            My skin was soaked<br/>
            I called your name 'til the fever broke<br/>
            When I awoke<br/>
            The moon still hung<br/>
            The night so black that the darkness hums</p>
         <p>I raised myself<br/>
            My legs were weak<br/>
            I prayed my mind be good to me<br/>
            An awful noise<br/>
            Filled the air<br/>
            I heard a scream in the woods somewhere</p>
         <p>Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh</p>
         <p>A woman's voice<br/>
            I quickly ran<br/>
            Into the trees with empty hands<br/>
            A fox it was<br/>
            He shook afraid<br/>
            I spoke no words, no sound he made</p>
         <p>His bone exposed<br/>
            His hind was lame<br/>
            I raised a stone to end his pain<br/>
            What caused the wound?<br/>
            How large the teeth?<br/>
            I saw new eyes were watching me</p>
         <p>Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh</p>
         <p>The creature lunged<br/>
            I turned and ran<br/>
            To save a life I didn't have<br/>
            Dear, in the chase<br/>
            There as I flew<br/>
            Forgot all prayers of joining you</p>
         <p>I clutched my life<br/>
            And wished it kept<br/>
            My dearest love, I'm not done yet<br/>
            How many years<br/>
            I know I'll bear<br/>
            I found something in the woods somewhere</p>
         <p>Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh</p>
