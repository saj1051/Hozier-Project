         <p>Rare is this love<br/>
            Keep it covered<br/>
            I need you to run to me, run to me,
            lover<br/>
            Run until you feel your lungs bleeding</p>
         <p>Oh but the farrow know<br/>
            Her hungry eyes, her ancient
            soul<br/>
            It's carried by the sneering menagerieKnow what it is to grow<br/>
            Beneath her sky, her punishing
            cold<br/>
            To slowly learn of her ancient
            miseryTo be twisted by something<br/>
            A shame without a sin<br/>
            Like how she twisted the bog man<br/>
            After she married him</p>
         <p>Rare is this love<br/>
            Keep it covered<br/>
            I need you to run to me, run to me,
            lover<br/>
            Run until you feel your lungs bleeding</p>
         <p>But in all the world<br/>
            There is one lover worthy of her<br/>
            With as many souls claimed as sheBut for all he's worth<br/>
            He still shatters always on her
            earth<br/>
            The cause of every tear she'd ever
            weepRushing to shore to meet her<br/>
            Foaming with loneliness<br/>
            White hands to fondle and beat
            her<br/>
            Give her his onliness</p>
         <p>Rare is this love<br/>
