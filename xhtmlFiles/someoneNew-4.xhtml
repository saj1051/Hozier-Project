      <article>
         <p>Don't take this the wrong way<br/>
            You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you<br/>
            Only blue or black days<br/>
            Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose</p>
         <p>Would things be easier if there was a right way?<br/>
            Honey, there is no right way</p>
         <p>And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone newI fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new</p>
         <p>There's an art to life's distraction<br/>
            To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through<br/>
            Some like to imagine<br/>
             The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do</p>
         <p>Would things be easier if there was a right way?<br/>
            Honey, there is no right way</p>
         <p>And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone newI fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new</p>
         <p>I wake at the first cringe of morning<br/>
            And my heart's already sinned<br/>
            How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha<br/>
            That you would pray for him'Cause Godknows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone newI fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone newI fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every day with someone new<br/>
            I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit<br/>
            Every dayâ€¦</p>
         <p>Love with every stranger<br/>
            The stranger the better<br/>
