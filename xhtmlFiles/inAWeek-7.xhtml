      <h2>In a Week</h2>
      <article>
         <p>I have never known peace<br/>
            Like the damp grass that yields to me<br/>
            I have never known hunger<br/>
            Like these insects that feast on me</p>
         <p>A thousand teeth<br/>
            And yours among them, I know<br/>
            Our hungers appeased<br/>
            Our heartbeats becoming slow</p>
         <p>We'll lay here for years or for hours<br/>
            Thrown here of found, to freeze or to thaw<br/>
            So long, we'd become the flowers<br/>
            Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw</p>
         <p>And they'd find us in a week<br/>
            When the weather gets hot<br/>
            After the insects have made their claim<br/>
            I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you</p>
         <p>I have never known sleep<br/>
            Like this slumber that creeps to me<br/>
            I have never known colour<br/>
            Like this morning reveals to me</p>
         <p>And you haven't moved an inch<br/>
            Such that I would not know<br/>
            If you sleep alwyas like this<br/>
            The flesh calmly going cold</p>
         <p>We'll lay here for years or for hours<br/>
            Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet<br/>
            So long, we'd become the flowers<br/>
            We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep</p>
         <p>And they'd find us in a week<br/>
            When the cattle show fear<br/>
            After the insects have made their claim<br/>
            After the foxes have known our taste<br/>
            I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you...</p>
         <p>They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)<br/>
            When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)<br/>
            And they'd find us in a week (We lay here for years of for hours)<br/>
            When the cattle show fear (So long we become the flowers)</p>
         <p>And they'd find us in a week<br/>
            When the buzzards get loud<br/>
            After the insects have made their claim<br/>
            After the foxes have known our taste</p>
         <p>And the raven has had his say<br/>
            I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you<br/>
            I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you<br/>
            I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you</p>
